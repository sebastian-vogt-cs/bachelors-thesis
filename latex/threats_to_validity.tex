\section{Threats to Validity} \label{sec:threats}
The set of apps used in our experiments is very small and generalizability to other apps is questionable.
Also, due to time constraints, the MIO executions had to be limited to a rather low number of iterations, which might make the performance results of MIO less reliable.
The number of iterations for the random walks differs from the de-facto standard of 1000 \cite{lio} because of time-constraints during the execution.
