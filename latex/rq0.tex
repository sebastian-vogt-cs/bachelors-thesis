\subsection[RQ0]{RQ0 - Can the information content measure be applied to the generated data?}\label{sec:rq0}

Before we can actually apply the information content measure to the random walks, we first have to make sure that equation \ref{eq:directaggr} holds for our data.
This is done by calculating both sides of the equation for every objective.
For this calculation, we used all objectives, and not just the ones that yielded MIO success values.

The maximum difference between the two sides of the equation is $0.0049$, which means that we can apply the information content as intended.
